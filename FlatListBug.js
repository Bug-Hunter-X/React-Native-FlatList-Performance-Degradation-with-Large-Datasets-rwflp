This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue manifests as slow scrolling, dropped frames, or even complete UI freezes. This is often caused by inefficient rendering of list items or excessive re-renders.  The problem is exacerbated by the use of computationally expensive operations within the renderItem function or if the data changes frequently without proper optimization.
